## Inspiration
In the spirit of staying up ungodly amount of hours trying to build a project, what inspired us to build Sleep Soon is the everyday hacker who is in desperate need of a good sleep schedule. Like many college students and working adults, we all could use some more sleep especially considering how busy people have become. 

## What it does
Sleep Soon takes the inputs from the user, particularly the amount of sleep they want to have, tasks they need to do, time to do those tasks, and the time for them to start the day and creates a scheduled tailored for them to finish those tasks and get them to bed by 9:00 pm. It also encourages the user to take breaks with healthy activities. 

## How we built it
We developed Sleep Soon using Python to power the backend, processing user inputs and generating personalized schedules. The frontend was built using HTML and CSS to provide an intuitive interface for users to input their preferences and view their custom schedule. Flask was used to tie everything together, making the app interactive and responsive. By focusing on simplicity and usability, we were able to create an app that anyone can use to get their work done efficiently while still prioritizing sleep.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was handling the complexity of scheduling tasks and balancing them against a fixed sleep window. We had to ensure that tasks, breaks, and sleep time fit into a 24-hour day while also making the experience seamless for the user. Another challenge was validating user inputs to ensure realistic schedulesâ€”making sure people weren't trying to cram too many tasks into an impossible timeframe. Not only that, we had a hard time trying to connect all of our teammates work together in a way that would look and feel smooth.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that this is our first time building out a project and we were able to come out with a finished product. This is big for us especially as First Time Hackers. We are also proud of our perseverance and our ability to problem solve as a team with this project.

## What we learned
We learned that we are able to use different languages in different files to help us build a better experience. Furthermore, we were fascinated that multiple programming languages can work in conjunction with each other. We also learned how to technically communicate with each other. Finally, we also learned how much fun and ridiculous a hackathon can be. 

## What's next for Sleep Soon
We hope to continue to work on this project and customize it to make it feel memorable and meaningful.
